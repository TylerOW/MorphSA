# MorphSA Framer Website

This repository contains a static export of the **Viper** Framer template. The `public` folder holds an offline version with all required assets. Open `public/viper-template.framer.website/index.html` in a browser to view the site.

All external URLs in this file have been converted to local paths so you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as needed.

## Missing asset files
Binary images and font files from the Framer export were removed from version control to avoid large diffs. Before viewing the site offline, download the original assets from Framer and place them under the same paths inside the `public` directory.
